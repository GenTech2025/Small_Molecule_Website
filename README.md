# Project Overview and Outcome
This project was completed as part of the *Introduction to Website and Database Design for Drug Discovery* course, taught by Dr. Alaisder Ivens. The primary objective was to develop a basic implementation of a small molecule search website, which serves as a front-end interface for accessing a MySQL database containing data on small molecule compounds.

## Project Details
The instructor provided a series of PHP files, which were written using an older version of PHP. Since many parts of the code were no longer compatible with the latest PHP version (PHP 8), the scripts were updated to ensure compatibility with this latest version. This included rewriting portions of the code to align with PHP 8 standards.

## Functionality
The website's primary functionality is a search feature that allows users to query the database using one or more filters. These filters enable users to search based on the manufacturer of the small molecule compounds, as well as their physical and chemical properties.

## Outcome
This project provided a valuable opportunity to build a fundamental understanding of designing and implementing databases and websites. Additionally, it involved deploying the project on a remote Linux server, offering hands-on experience with server-side management and deployment.
